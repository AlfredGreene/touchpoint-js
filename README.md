# TouchPoint.js

A tiny vanilla JavaScript library made for in-browser HTML prototyping (as part of the UX process) that visually shows where the user clicks/taps on-screen with CSS3 transitions. TouchPoint is highly customizable, mobile ready and great for screencasting, screen recording, user testing and presentations.

**Live demo: [codepen.io/jonahvsweb/full/bdQmpd/](http://codepen.io/jonahvsweb/full/bdQmpd/)**

## Installation
Download and include `touchpoint.js` or `touchpoint.min.js` in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>` (recommended) in your HTML document. There are no dependencies:

```html
<script src="touchpoint.min.js"></script>
```

## Quick Start/How to Use
After you load the script you simply initialize TouchPoint and add an event listener to whatever element you want TouchPoint to show over: 

```html
<script>
	TouchPoint.init();
	window.addEventListener("click", TouchPoint.create, false);
</script>
```

**That's it!**

## Options
TouchPoint is customizable. There are a number of options that you have access to to customize the look for your needs. It's important that these options be defined before you initialize TouchPoint with `TouchPoint.init()`. Otherwise, your updates won't show.

#### Color
Change the default color of TouchPoint. Any valid CSS color can be used. Default: '#FFF'
```html
TouchPoint.color = 'red';
```

#### Element
Change the kind of HTML element that TouchPoint creates. 

Default: 'div'
```html
TouchPoint.el = 'span';
```

#### Opacity
Change the opacity of the TouchPoint. You can use any value between `0` and `1`. 

Default: '0.8'
```html
TouchPoint.opacity = 0.5;
```

#### Scale
Change the final scale of the TouchPoint. This value can range from `0` and beyond. 

Default: '8'
```html
TouchPoint.size = 14;
```

#### Size
Change the initial size of the TouchPoint. This value is `px`. 

Default: '20'
```html
TouchPoint.size = 5;
```

#### zIndex
Change the zIndex of the TouchPoint. By default it's set at the highest `z-index` depth possible, but you may find the need to change it based on your own prototype. 

Default: '9999'
```html
TouchPoint.z = 500;
```
